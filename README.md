# Drinkstagram
Drinkstagram is a mobile, social media app that creates a database of bar/restaurant ratings by using users' social media posts to create average ratings for the location the post was made.

When a user logs in or signs up, they are brought to their profile page, which displays the user's most recently made posts.

The user can then travel to their news feed to see the most recently made posts for users they are following. A post consists of a title of the drink, the location where the drink was purchased, an image of the drink, a caption for the image, and a rating out of 5 for how good the drink was. Users can leave comments on posts for others to see. A user can make a post by simply uploading a picture (or immediately taking one in the app) and then filling out a form that will construct the post.

The ratings are then used to compile an average rating for the bar/restaurant the drink was ordered from. By constantly including new posts into the average, the rating for each bar will get more accurate as more users post about the bar.

Users can find bars in their area via a Google Maps plugin, that allows users to find bars that other people have posted about in their area.
